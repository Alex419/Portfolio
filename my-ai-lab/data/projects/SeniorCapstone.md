# Senior Capstone Project: DIY Gamma-Ray Spectrometer

## Project Overview
Our senior capstone project was an interdisciplinary effort to design, build, and thoroughly test a low-cost, student-engineered **Gamma Ray Spectrometer (GRS) payload**. The core objective was to demonstrate the feasibility of detecting gamma radiation and accumulating energy spectrum data using highly accessible components, contrasting sharply with conventional GRS systems that can cost upwards of hundred of millions of dollars. Our budget for this project was approximately **$2,000**. The project was an exploration into whether a DIY system could collect meaningful scientific data, focusing on creating a robust, reproducible prototype for future research.

## Core Problem & Motivation
Modern Gamma Ray Spectrometer (GRS) systems are prohibitively expensive, costing hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars. This cost severely limits access for underfunded schools, researchers in developing countries, and individuals needing spectroscopic data. Our primary motivation was to develop an affordable alternative that could still produce quality data, reflecting a broader ethical commitment to **equity and accessibility in science and engineering**.

## Key Design & Subsystems
The project aimed to develop a complete GRS circuit design and prototype, reproducible by others. To support potential high-altitude data collection (a reach goal for real-world data), we also designed two crucial, independent subsystems:
1.  **Gamma Ray Spectrometer (GRS) System:**
    * **Purpose:** Detect gamma radiation, convert it into an electrical signal, and extrapolate the energy level from that signal. Over time, accumulate signals to produce an energy spectrum graph (histogram of energy ranges vs. frequency).
    * **Inspiration:** Modeled after Professor Lavelle's research on gamma ray detection circuits.
    * **Components:** Utilized a Bismuth Germanate (BGO) crystal for detection. We designed our circuit for a **Teensy 4.1 microcontroller** (chosen for its smaller size and lighter weight compared to Arduino Uno, as per the inspiring paper's use case).
2.  **Temperature Control System:**
    * **Purpose:** To maintain the BGO crystal (essential for gamma ray detection) within its required stable operating temperature range, crucial for reliable data acquisition at varying altitudes.
    * **Methodology:** Relied heavily on **PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) control logic** to smoothly regulate the payload's internal temperature, taking into account current temperature and projecting future rates of change.
3.  **Altitude Control System:**
    * **Purpose:** Designed to monitor and control helium release from a weather balloon to regulate altitude changes. This was conceptualized to allow the GRS to stay at a desired altitude for sufficient data accumulation and ensure a controlled descent for payload recovery.
    * **Methodology:** Also based on **PID control logic**, similarly adjusting helium release smoothly over time.

## Our Process & Collaborative Approach
Our team, composed primarily of **Computer Science** students with additional expertise in **Physics** and **Electrical Engineering**, engaged in a highly iterative design and validation process. The initial phase heavily focused on **identifying potential issues**, including component suitability, ethical considerations, and logical challenges, to ensure a complete and robust design.

### Key Phases:
1.  **Research & Feasibility:**
    * Explored the viability of a low-cost gamma ray detection system given our resources and budget.
    * Researched commercially available sensors, legal/FAA requirements (for future launch), and power considerations.
    * Defined a realistic MVP: a self-contained payload that logs radiation and altitude data, built to survive extreme conditions (though never launched), and designed for recoverability.
2.  **Component Testing & Integration:**
    * Thoroughly tested individual components, including the gamma ray spectrometer, GPS module, barometric pressure/temperature sensors.
    * Developed Arduino code to integrate these components, continuously log data with timestamps, display system status, and handle errors (e.g., GPS loss, SD card issues) gracefully.
    * **We debugged countless hardware issues**, gaining significant real-world experience in breadboard grounding and modular code design.
3.  **Physical Payload Design & Construction:**
    * Focused on designing the layout of the payload and its components within a lightweight, insulated enclosure.
    * Designed for **internal thermal shielding**
4.  **Ground Tests & Validation:**
    * While the payload was never launched into the atmosphere, we conducted**on-the-ground simulations and tests** to validate its functionality and robustness.
    * This included continuous power tests to check for overheating/crashes, GPS testing, and simulating high-altitude inputs (low pressure, cold) for the temperature control unit.
    * We spent significant time **testing and tuning the PID control logic** for both the temperature and altitude control systems to ensure the code behaved as intended for smooth, accurate regulation.
